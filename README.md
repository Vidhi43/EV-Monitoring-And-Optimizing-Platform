# EV-Monitoring-And-Optimizing-Platform
Growing uptake of electric vehicles (EV) has placed some of the most pressing
charging infrastructure issues in the spotlight, such as system failure, energy loss, and
poor site planning. Such conditions result in inefficiencies within operation and
challenges in the user experience. This project envisions the EV Monitoring and
Optimizing Platform, an innovative, cloud-based platform that combines AI, IoT, and
Big Data technologies. The platform employs IoT sensors to measure in real-time
station performance and facilitate proactive fault detection and predictive maintenance.
Such analysis, based on it, results in strategic infrastructure expansion
decision-making and optimization of charging management. The outcome is an
efficient and reliable EV charging network that facilitates data-driven city and service
provider decision-making as well as optimizes the total charging experience for
consumers.
